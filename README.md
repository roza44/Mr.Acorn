# Mr. Acorn

Mr. Acorn is a third person Android game demo made in Unity. The purpose of this demo is to represent my knowledge in the game development area. In this game the player navigates the main character, called Mr.Acorn, through the night themed street. All models, their materials  and animations are made by myself in the Blender 3D editor. All controllers and scripts, including UI joystick controllers, are made by myself, too. In order to achieve better performance, lights used in this game are baked and combined into several lightmaps and all the models are low poly. 

For the best experience, I highly recommend you to download the following .apk file and install Mr. Acorn demo on your Android: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DgUglSeo5XpIbdpGOk4vpRqFG7U5_Vv2/view?usp=sharing
